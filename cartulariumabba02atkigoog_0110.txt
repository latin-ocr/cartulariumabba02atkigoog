¹ There is some uncertainty about the reading of this word, though none
as to its meaning. It is identical with the word “raimblis ’' in No. 449.
The reading adopted is probably the right one, though “ raimblum,” “ rami·
blum,’' or ‘⁴ raimllum,’' are all possible from the uncertain forms of the
letters. In my Cleveland Glossary Ι have printed the word ‘⁴ Gramma, the
larger boughs of trees of gnarled and twisted growth, such as are frequent iu
the oak.” And Mr. F. K. Robinson, in his Glossary of “ Words used in the
neighbourhood of Whitby,'' has inserted “ Gra-mmet, the large knotted
branches of trees.’' I have, in this district, heard the term “ yach-ramm'ls ’'
employed, and it occurred to me that the c in Mr. Robinson's eranum-le and
my mammes, might possibly be due to the preceding k in yack (=oak).
The author of the Dialect of Oravcn prints ‘⁸ Ramile, underwood, twigs. Lat.
ramulus,” and cites-

“To write of scroggis, brome, hadder or ramell,

(Doug. Virg.)'’
and a second passage from the same, in which the word occurs in the form
rammell ; and I think there can be no doubt that this is the correct form.
Stin it is quite clear from the word in No. 449 that a b had found entrance,
and the reading here possibly ought to be raimblum, which would be con-
sistent with the reading in the deed just noticed.

² See Note l, p. 448.
³ A witness also in the case of No. 443.
