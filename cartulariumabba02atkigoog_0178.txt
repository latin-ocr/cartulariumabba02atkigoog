¹ Eboraca’.

² The position of Kesebec is indicated in note 1 (p. 218) to No. 273. The
vaccary there is also named in No. 1, p. 3, as well as elsewhere. The Earl
of Albemarle’s lordships in Yorksbire were exceedingly extensive, and
embraced, among other lands in the part of the county concerned‚ certain
territory in Briniston or Burniston. which would bring him into the close
vicinity of the Kesewck district, From No. 263 it is apparent that the
Priory of Bridlington had a free tenement in Scalby, Burniston and
Cloughtoxu and Dugdale (Baranam, i. 62) mentions considerable donations
made by william de Fortibus to the Canons of Bridlington⁹ ‘⁸ which gift was
in recompence of some wrongs he had done to them.” It is by no means
impossible that these “ wrongs’' were of the same nature, and done at the
same time, with those specified in the present document as inflioted on
Whitby.

³ Corneley. 1 bave ventured on this- emendation, inasmuch as the
‘⁸ vaccaria ’' of Thornley is named in No. 1 (p. 3) just before Kesebec aud in
other places as well, as it is in the close vicinity of Kesebec locally, and as
no place with any name resembling Corneley is ever mentioned in connection
with Whitby or its possessione.

⁴ Itis scarcely possible to identify the places here named, no clue at all

being given as to their locality. There is a Peter de Westiby‚ described iu
oue chartei· as “Serviens Prioris,'’ who occurs some scores of times as a
witness to divers documents in the Gysburne Chartulary, and of course
Westiby is a local name, but where it was'is uncertain. The orthography
of the second name is probably as it stands in the text, though the initial
might possibly be intended for a D. As to Slethom, the only place so
named that Ι am acquainted with is the Slethollme named at p. 125 of
Kirkby’s laqueat, and of which the Editor mistakenly writes that it is pno-
bably an error for Lealholm. Lealholm was in the Brus fee, and is, more-
over, specially dealt with in the documents connected with the partition‚
whereas Sletholm is specified as being in the Mauley see. It was in fact, as
is made quite certain by documento in the Gysburne Chartulary, more in the
Ugthorpe direction, aud Ι have little doubt that its local site is marked by
the farm now called Bamby Sleights. But this Sletholm lies so far wide of

the Earl of Albemarle’s probable forest-raids that it can scarcely be the
place meant iu this document.
