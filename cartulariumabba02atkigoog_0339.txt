¹ It hardly need be said this is a random statement and devoid of
authority.

² ‘⁸ This narrative is mainly derived from the History of the Chureh of
Durham, with some additions and occasional variations. It does not appear
from the Durham History that the pilgrims specially directed their steps to
Monkchester‚ or indeed knew anything of it. Their information respecting
the ancient monasteries was from Beda, who makes no mention of Monk-
chester, for the identification of which with Newcastle·upon-Tyne‚ we are
also indebted to the present work, supported by other authorities of some·
what more recent date.”
