CARTULARIUM ABBATmAE DE WHITEBY. 719

the Abbot and Gregory Oonyers, citing an agreement made
19 Henry vm. by Gregory Conyers, that John Hexham, Prior
of Middilsburgh, should be Abbot of Whitby, William Johnson,
Bursar, William Olarkson, Prior of Medilsburgh and N ewham,
and Richard Hope, Kitchener and Proctor of the Parish Church3
for recognition of which Gregory was to have a tithe-corn of
N ewham and Dunsley.

“ Memorandum.—The 23d year of the reign of our sovereign
lord, King Henry vm„ after the Convocation, when our master
came home, 1, Dan Robert Wodhus, Prior, demanded, ‘ What
news 2⁹ and he said, ‘ Evil news: for the King's grace was
ruled by one common stued huer, Anne Bullan, who made all
the spiritualty to be beggared, and the temporalty also 1’
Also, another time, when he came from York, he told the Prior
of a man that preached, and said, when the great wind rose in
the west we should have news afterward. And he asked what
that was. And he said, a great man told him at York, and if
he knew as much as three in England he could tell what these
news were. And he asked what they were: and he said, the
duke of N orfolk, the earl of Wiltshire, and the common stued
huer, Anne Bullan.’'

¹ It has been thought best to print the following pages with as much
fulness as possible on account of the immense mass of carious and precise
information contained ss to the several possessione and sources oi income
possessed by the Abbey in its prosperity. The details given are so precise,
and descend to such particular-s, that, where unfortunately gaps exist, or
omission—perhaps inevitsble under the circumstances-are noticed, the

feeling experienced by the student is always that of regret that such defl-
ciencies in the sources oi our knowledge do in fact exist.
