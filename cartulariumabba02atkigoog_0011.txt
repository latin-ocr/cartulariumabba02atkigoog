INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.

THE volume from which tho documents in the first part oi
the present volume, numbered 400 to 57 4, both inclusive, and
which is designated as M in Vol. i„ is a volume in the British
Museum, distinguished by the mark “Add. MSS. 4715.'’ It is
os less size than the sister volume at Whitby, belonging to Sir
Charles Strickland, from which the documents in Vol. i. were
derived, and bearing externally, from the care of the Museum
authoritieS, a less antique appearance. The first nine pages
are oi paper which have been bound up with the parchment or
vellum pages of the book. Of these, 1, 1¹³, and 2 are blank.
On 2¹³ the following entry is made :—“ This ancient Manuscript
“ was presented by Dr. Mason of Trin. Coll. Camb„ to the British
Museum, by the Hands of Mr. Penneck, on Friday the 7 th of
November 1701. It relates to the Abbey of Whitby in York-
shire.”

It may be remarked here that Pennack or Pennock is a
familiar family name in Whitby and East Oleveland, and that
it is met with, in the form Penok, at pp. 15, 17, 19, 20, 20-22‚
in Vol. i., as well as elsewhere.

On p. 3 of the volume, there is this insertion :—“ This
Cartulary is manifestly wrote at different Times, as well as by
different Hands. It seems to have been an old book pulld in
peiceS, and put together again,1 with fresh vellum between:

¹ This is rather misleading3 for not au οἱ the original book has been “put
together, ’' and unfortunately so ς for all the earlier leaves, including, it
would appear, Percy char-tere mainly, as well as several others in the body
of the volume, also containing Percy chartei-s (as will appear on consulting
the old Index, given after No. 574), are missing, and there is reason to think
that some among them are not now to be met with at all, as they are not

in the Strickland volume.
