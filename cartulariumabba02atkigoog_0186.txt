² One would gladly identify this place with the dale or vale through which
the Brocholebeclt¹ named iu N os. 190, 191, 616., ssows, if it were possible, or
even reasonably probable. The only local clue throughout, in our ignorance
of what and where Midethet—hardly corrupted out of Midethwait at that
early date—and Thus were, is that the boundary of the land granted started
from a certain ‘⁸ balk ‘' which lay between the wandales of de Percy's
demesne, and those of his homagers. Now, there is reason 16 suppose that
the lord’s residence lay on the seaward side of the site of Dunsley Chapel‚
aud probably the vandeloe named lay north of the chapel and hall. If this
were so, one might perhaps trace the name Broccheshole in Trucky Rock
Hele, which is marked on the 6·ineh Ordnance Survey, about one-third of a
mile north of the South Lodge (admitting to the Mulgrave woods), and just
a little to the west side of the drive. It is not likely that the 6166 enclosed
was very considerable, and the entire delineation is extremely obscure.

³ Vivien Presbiter attests No. 43, a 61161161· by Robert de Percy, son of
Pichot de Percy, and 6 cotemporary of the grantor of the present 61161161 3

Ugalbardeby, etc.

⁴ Ricardus de Dunesle attests No. 65, by the same donor.

⁶ He too attests Ne. 43 3 66 6166 No. 208 by the author of the present deed.
