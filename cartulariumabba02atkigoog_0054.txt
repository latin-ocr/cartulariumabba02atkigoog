of feoffment was, in general, the only written instrument whereby lands
were transferred or conveyed. But although this assurance derived great
authenticity from the number of witnesses by whom it was usually attested,
aud from the solemn and public manner in which livery oi seisin was
formally given, yet still it may be supposed that inconveniences would
frequently arise, either from the loss of the charter itself, or from the
difficulty of proving it after a lapse of years. These circumstances probably
induced men to look out for some other species of assurance which should
be more solemn, more lasting, and more easy to be proved than a charter of
feoffment. Experience must soon have discovered that 110 title could be
so secure and notorious as that which had been questioned by an adverse
party, and ratified by the determination of a Court of J ustiee ; and the
ingenuity of mankind soon found out the method of drawing the same
advantages from a fictitious process. 'ro effect this purpose the following
plan was adopted. A suit was commenced concerning the lands intended to
be conveyed, and when the writ was sued out, and the parties appeared in
Court, a composition of the suit was entered into with the consent of the
J udges, whereby the lands in question were acknowledged to be the right of
one of the contending parties. This agreement, being reduced into writing,
was enrolled among the recorda oi the Court, where it was preserved by the
public officer ς by which means it was not so liable to be lost as a charter of
feoffment, and would at all times prove itself, and being substituted in place
01 the sentence which would have been given had the suit not been com·
pounded, it was to be held of equal force with the judgment of a Court of
J ustice.” Now the difficulty in the present case originates in the eircum—
stance that the payment of the large sum oi 1000 marks seems, judging
by the present very formal receipt, to have been real, and the proceedings
certainly not “ fictitious.” Indeed, if we allow very largely for Oharlton's
peculiar mode of positive but baseless assertion, and admit only two or
three of his precise statements, we shall still have ample reason to believe
the ‘⁶ process'’—however irreconcilable the supposition with very notorious
facts—very much in earnest indeed. Char-lton (p. 225) says: “About the
time when William of Kirkham was elected Abbot of Whitby, the third
Lord Peter de Malo-lacu came to the possession of the two extensive mauors
of Mulgrave and Egton; and believing the same to be boundered by the river
Eske, he put in a claim to all that part oi Whitby which lies on the west
side of the same river. Also at the same time he instigated Mt. John of
Tocotes, who was then minister of Lyth, to demand tithes from the in-
habitants of Risewarp, Aselby‚ Neuham, Dunseley, Stakesby‚ and that hali
of Whitby which lies on the west side of the Eske. But the land·
