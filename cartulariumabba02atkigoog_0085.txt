employed just below, 16 needed.

² This might read nissen, but is probably 66 in the text, snd the old
French mes, from mure, 6169 mean either the things deposited for 6616

⁴ The Acredike‚ which appears ιο have had its 16661 habit-tion in 66611 of
the townships just named, is mentioned again below (No. 474), sud again in
connection with the right of common in it. But no positive clue 16 afforded

to are—certainly the last named is—much older than Hilda's time, and
massive dikes do not tend much to go ιο (16669, however much they 1669
