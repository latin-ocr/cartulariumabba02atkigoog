ΙΝ TRODUCTORY CHAPTER. xi

quite patent, alike from the preservation of the French deed
⁴ printed as No. 57 6, and from Gascoigne's mention of and
extracts from what he speaks of as “libri de Whitby’' belong-
ing to the Cholmleys‚ and other matters noticed in the pages
of these volumes. What they were, and what has become of
them, are now matters of the merest speculation. Effectually
they do not exist.

Touching the other constituente of this volume, and passing
by the French charter by Henry de Percy from Dodsworth,
and the two original charters connected with the Hermitage at
Dunsley, with no further special notice, the copies of account
rolls stin preserved at Whitby, and of Young's imperfect copy
of yet others, and the extracta from the Archbishops' Registers
are the most noteworthy. Both are full of interest, and of
interest of various kinds, and it is hard to say of one class that
it exceeds the other in its claims upon our consideration. For
the permission to examine these RegisterS, and the facilit-ies
afforded me in executing the task‚ I have to acknowledge
myself under great obligation to Messrs Hudson and Buckle.
The civility and attention evinced at their office was remark-
able and uniform. The remainder of the material of the
volume has been picked up in many places and derived from
the memoranda of many years, and it is not without a sort of
regret that the editor thus closes a task which has been his
pleasure and labour of love for the last ten or eleven years—
the first transcript of the Strickland copy—“ the Abbot’s Book '’
—having been made for his own purposes in the years 1868
and 1869.
