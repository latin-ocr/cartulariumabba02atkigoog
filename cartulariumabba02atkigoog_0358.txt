1⁸. Ernaldus [or Ernulfus] de ΡεηὉγ.2
ΙΙ. 1. Ernaldus de Percy.³
2. Robertus [or Rodbertus] de Pei-cy.⁴

about the fifteenth century, again became lords of Kildsle on fsilure of
issue.

Χ. 1. (Descent continued from the lsst Walter de Percy, m. to a wife
whose name is not known) Sir Nicholas de Percy, died sp. (Harl. uss.
1420, p. 19).

2. william de Percy, lord of Kildsle 1252: held in 13 Edw. 1. one knight's

thorus, Berwick-on-Tees, Ormesby, Normanby and Imnby, in Clevelsnd ς

XII. 1. Sir Arnold de Percy de Kildale 1295, and 1312, etc.

¹ The proofs are ss follows z—Witness with Thomas, Archbishop of York,
to the Foundation Charter of william de Percy, ove les gernuns, to Whitby
<N 6. 26, p. 32), which dates before 1096.

² a. Gives ιο Gysburne Priory (Foundation Charter by Rob. de Brus,
Gysburne chartul. f. 215) “ecclesiam de Ormesby, et molendinum de

Kaldecotes, etc.” He was therefore lord of Ormesby, Kaldecotes, etc., before
11 19.

b. Witness to Robert de Brus’ charter (No, 111) conveying the Church of
S. Hilda at Middlesburch‚ etc., ιο Whitby.

c. Witness, ‘⁴ cum duobus filiis ej us‚’' to the Conventio “ inter domum de
Witcby et (16 Gisburnia’' (No, 271), settled before Robert de Brus, and
william (16 Brus first Prior of Gysburne, probably (or certainly) before 1135.
It is scarcely possible ιο identify Ι. and 1⁸. ss certainly the same person.

It is possible, but considering the length of time involved, perhaps hardly
probable.
