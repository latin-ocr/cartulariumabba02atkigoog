¹ A document of eonsiderable interest in several respecta, especially as
giving an early and important charter οἱ which we have no other copy, and
also in minor matters, such as establishing the descent of Fulco Dapiier,
and of Aschetin de Haukesgarth, and cleariug up some uncertainties of
name, etc„ in other 611666.

² The issue of Agnes de Perci by her husband, J ocelin de Lo'uvain‚ were
Richard de Pet-cy, the eldest son, Henry de Percy‚ and Matilda. The
latter married John Daivill. On the death of Richard without issue, Hem-y
succeeded to the entire inheritance. His eldest son was william, who
appears to have married (1) J oanna, daughter of William Briwer‚ by whom
he had only female issue ; and (2) Sibilla (16 valoines, his children by whom
were Henry de Percy, Engelram‚ william, Alan‚ and Joceline. fleury, the
eldest of these, sueoeeded his father in his honours and estates, and was in
turn suceeeded by his son Hem-y, the author of the present deed, and 116
appears to bave died about five years after its date.

³ It is worthy of note that this Inspeximus specifles ‘⁴ cartas willelmi et
Alani de Percy‚'' but proceeds to give only that of the latter, notwithstanding
the addition οἱ the precise words “in haec verba.‘' Is it to be understood
that the charter by Alan de Pet-oy, first reeited, is tobe regarded as one that
repeats or comprehende that by his father! cf. Nos. 27 and 279, in the
former of which William de Percy granta “francigenam decimam annonae
hallae’' in the several places speeified in the present charter‚ and in the
latter confirma, with the sanction aud confirmation of King Henry, ‘⁶ decimas
carucarum de dominio meo ” in the said places. It may be noticed also that
in the chat-ter last referred to the witnesses are the same, with some varia·
tions in spelling, etc. (noticed in the notes on p. 224), and with the fuller
description in the case of Fulco Dapiser, as in the chat-ter now under notice.
