In reference to Note on p. 595.

Sotularie, some kind of {oct-covering or stocking. In the Treamry of St.
Paul‘e, am. 1295, there were—“Sandalia de rubro saincte, cum caligis
brendatis: . . . Secularee cunt brendatae ad modum crucie.'’-(Dugdale'a
Hister-y of St. Panes, p. 315.) “Saular, pro socco. Sotulmie, genus calcea·
menti—Vota. Vide Subtalareffi Under Eubulus-is, the meaning given iz
“pedum tegmen.'’—(Glosaarium‚ drawn from Vossius, Dufresne, ete.)

‘⁸ De Sotium-ibae. Hic quoque Sotularen corrigiatou de cute quam vulgus
Bazan appellat, commutavit, tum ad divinum officium expeditius properarent,
nec unus alium in processionibus intricatum illaquearet, tum propter mun-
ditiam et honestatem ftatrum, quon decet manus (et maxime circa altare)
habere mundissimae: priore tamen rotunditate anteriore et per totum
amplitudine, ad indicium priatinae humilitatis, remanente—(Mat. Parin„
Vitae Viyinti Trium Sancti Albam· Abbatoem, 660, among the Institutee oi the
Abbot Guarinus.) ’

NOTE ‘ro No. DCVI. (p. 654, vol. ii.)

It may be remarked in connection with the Libera Questus, printed ae
N o. 606, that a fact of some little interest touching the still existing remains
of the Abbey Ohurch of Wbitby is therein brought out—namely, the date
at which a certain portion of the fabric wat in process of construction. It
hae already been noted that, in the main, the erection of the earlier part oi
the said Church‚ aa it stands, was contemporaneum with the presidency
oi Abbot Roget. Further, it is clear that the great building effort then
instituted was not relaxed until, after a period of perhaps twenty-five or
thirty years, the choir, the tower (or the main part of it), the transepts‚ and
three bays to the went oi the tower had been completed. Tben the effert
could be no longer continued. Whether the available resources failed, or
the exieting funde had been overdrawn, cannot be told, but nothing more,
judging from the architectum only, appears to have been done in the way
of ‘adding to the extent of the nave for the greater part of a century, when
two bays more were built on to the buttree· to the tower formed by the
three already erected. From the style of thece additional baye it ie at once
apparent that the work belongs to the earlier part of the fourteenth century,
and the date of the Lieera Quantus under notice settlea the question ae to
the precise time at which the work was going on ; while the document which
follows next (No. 607) limita the time before which it had come to an end.
