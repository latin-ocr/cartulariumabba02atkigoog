CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 385

we have this Symon’s son Peter, and his sister Margaret, who is described as
Symon's heir-apparent-the male line therefore closing in him—uniting in a
certain quitclaim. The succession, with one break, would then appear to
be fairly clear z—l. Willelmus de Pemy, Ohtlesgernuns. 2. Ricardus de
Percy de Dnnsley, filius Willelmi. 3. Willelmus, etc., as follows :—

It should, however, be noted here that Charlton (Whitby, p. 227), ι·8·
forring to the claim he supposes to have been made by Peter de Mauley
111. to certain portions of the Whitby territory, a matter which will be
dealt with at a subsequent page (see Nos. 444-446, No, 592, and notes),
caym—‘⁴ From the rolls that are yet preserved relating to this trial

 

we learn . . . that between the years 1230 and 1283 there were four
of the name of Percy who lived at Dunsley‚ and successively possessed the
same, viz„ william de Percy, who was living anno 1230, and was suc·
ceeded by Richard, after whom came Alan, and Alan was succeeded by
Winiam de Percy, who was living anno 1283.’‘ Unluckily all the rolls here
referred ιο, save the one printed below (No. 592, already named) have en·
tirely disappeared, aud it is impossible to test Cbarlton’s accuracy‚ as any one
with experience of his statements must be necessarily impelled to do. But
it will be seen that his first william tallies well with N 0. VI. in the above
descent; that his Richard agrees with No. V11.; but that there is scanty
room for Alan between vn. and vul„ especially if VIII. was lord in 1283.
In the absence of witnesses’ names, it is not possible to decide with certainty
which of the three Richards de Percy de Dunsley the grantor of the present
confirmation, or of No. 434, really is.
