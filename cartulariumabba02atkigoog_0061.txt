(48¹²) Notum sit omnibus ad quos hoc scr. perv„ praes. et fut„
ita convenisse inter Petrum,¹ Abbatem‚ et Conv. Eccl. S. Petri et
S. Hildae de Whiteby‚ et Reginaldum de 1106616,εἰ pro se et pro
haer. suis—scil. quod idem Reginaldus qu. clamavit de se et de
omnibus suis totum jus et totum clam. quod se habere dicebat
in capella de Aselby quam praed. Conv. ei dederat in puram
elem, sicut clerico suo, et cartam quam ab eis habebat de
praefata elem. praedictae capellae, et 'clavem ejusdem capellae
reddidit omnino quietas in manu praedicti Abbatis et Con-
ventus, Et praeter haec recognovit et liberam et qu. clamavit
praed. Eccl. de Whiteby, et omnibus transeuntibus viam illam
per mediam aquam et per mediam illam particulam t’rae juxta
molendinum suum—quae scil. via recognita fuit coram J usti-
ciariis D’ni RegiS, et in Com. Ebor., per duodecim liberos et
legales milites de visnetO, quod via regia esse debuit et debet
et debebit imperpetuum. Et praeter haec concessit praed.

Reginaldus, pro se et pro haer. suis, praed. Abbati et
monachis pontem facere perpetuum ⁸ ultra aquam de Eske

¹ Abbot Peter, it is likely, succeeded about the year 1190 οι· 1191, and
died about 1211.

² In No. 81, Radulphus dc Laceles grants a certain tenement in Liverton
to Abbot Peter, and among the witnesses is Reginald de Rosel, no doubt the
present grantor. The interest of the Roselles family in Aselby was clearly
one of long standing.

³ It is hence apparent that the original of the bridge now standing close
to Sleights Station must have been quite one of the earliest permanent
bridges (“ pons perpetuus '') in the district. One in Westerdale yet remaius,
which probably dates back to c. 1280-1300. Another, somewhat unneces·
sarily destroyed some few years agn, stood near Castleton Station, which
could scarcely have been later than that last named, and was distinguished
by the same sort of longitudinal ribbing as is still observable in what is
called the ‘⁴ dungeon ” at Danby Castle, a structure which must have been
completed quite within the first ten years of the fourteenth century. A
third stood where the road crosses the Esk near Danby Station, and was re·
moved to make way for the present structure early in the present century.
No sketch or notice of its form or features has been preserved. The next is
about one-third of a mile north of Danby Castle, and was built about 1385
by Neville Lord Latimer, whose arms are yet in sicu on its upper west side.
Yet a fifth still stands very near Glaisdale Station, being the well-known
“ Beggar’s Bridge,'’ the myths connected with which are equally well known.
