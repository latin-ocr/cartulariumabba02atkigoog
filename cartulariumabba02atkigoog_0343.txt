the inaccuracies and mis-statements involved in the two genealogies which
follow the present one. Beyond doubt the most accurate and trustworthy
pedigree of the family named, available to the genealogical inquiret, is that
given by Dodsworth (ii. f. 2), each important link in which is supported by
its several authority ; and, instead of exposing in detail the principal errors
or blunders in the following genealogies, it may be a better method of pro-
cedure to note down the separate generations as given in Dodsworth, making
only such additions as are suggested by facts or inferences stated or inspired
in the present volumes.

L 1. William de Percy, ove les gernuns. Fonnded the Monastery of
Whitby. A tenant in capite in 1086: ob. 1096, and was buried at Mons·
gandium, in the Holy Laud.

2. Serlo de Percy, brother of the Fonnder‚ and first Prior ε probably died
early in the twelfth century.

3. de Percy, a third brother. This is to be inferi-ed, though perhaps
not with absolute certainty, from the fact that the first Abbot of Whitby,
described as a nephew of the Founder, was named William de Percy. Of
course he may not have been born in wedlock and yet have borne the name,
as will be seen was the case in the third generation. But the presumption‚
from the way in which he is named, is that he was not illegitimate, and, if

' not, there must have been a third brother. This is the more probable
because Aaliza de Perci, who was successively the wife of Hugh de Boithorpe
and Reginald Busceh was a niece of Prior Serlo’s, and could have stood in
that relationship to him only as daughter of his brother. And the same is
more forqibly true of the wife of Wimund de Lockinton, whose name is not
given, but whose son, Ace de Lockington, is described as nephew to Abbot
William de Percy (see No, 1, p. 4).

 

11. 1. Alan de Percy, son of Winiam de Percy ove les gernum, by

. Emma de Porte. Probably died before 1133, certainly before 1135, as his

son William granted his charter to Whitby during the lifetime of Henry 1.

2. Walter de Percy (see Nos. 27, 28,’ ete).

3. Richard de Percy, de Dunsley‚ for a notice of whose descendants, see
No. 431 and notes.

4. william de Percy, an ecclesiastic. His name, with the distinctive
appellation ‘Canonicus’ following it, is met with in No, 89, and again in
No, 253. He is named as son of Williarn de Percy ove les gernuns in
No. 27, and as brother of Alan in No. 28.

111. 1. william de Percy, son of Alan de Percy by Emma de Gante.
Man-ied, (1) Aaliza or Adelidis de Tunebrigge (in Dodsworth‚ probably by a
scribal error, Matildis); (2) Sibilla de Valoines or Vallines, who survived
