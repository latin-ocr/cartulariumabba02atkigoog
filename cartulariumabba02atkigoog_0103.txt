¹ Skeat (Etymol. Dict. Enql. Lanquaqe) under “ Gable, a peak of a house-
top‚” quotes ‘⁶ Ο. Fr. yable, a rare word cited by Stratmann,” and adds, ⁸⁸ cf.
Low Lat. ραὸιιῖυπι, a gable, sront of a building ;” but none among the parallel
words from other languages deviato from the customary sense, pointed frent
of a building‚ or fork ς at least if we except Moeso-Goth. qibla, which means
pinnacle as well as qable. Used as the word is here, in relation to a pointed hill-
end with sloping sides—a feature by no means uncommon in the vicinity of
Hackness—it is a striking term. There is a conspicuous pointed hill of this
character as seen from the Fylingdales Moci-s, not far from High Langdale
End, to which it would be singular-ly applicable; and even as looked at in
its delineation on the Ordnance Survey maps. Unluckily‚ it does not seem
possible to identify the hill called Gildecleve (ἲ Gildcliff), especially as the
word commented on in the next note is of uncertain meaning.

² Mera may be a latinieed form of the word mere, meaning “lake, large
body of fresh water‚” as in the case of Seamer Mere (now and for long past
much reduced in size by dminage), or it may represent mere, boundary mark
or stone. Were it certainly the former, the large pond or lake in the Hack·
nese Hau grounds might be designated. ³ See laet deod, No 4597.
