OARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 703

Mautalent: m. Alicia de Menell,1 daughter of John de Μ611611,
son of John de Menell de Castle LeVington.
IX„ 1. John de Percy :² m. Elizabeth.

² Alicia de Menneu, described iu one document quoted in the Percy
Feod, which will be noted below, as “filia J ohannis filii Johannis de Men-
nell,’' and erroneously alleged to have become, after the decease of her
husband John de Percy, the wife of Sir Walter Boynton, was the grand·
daughter of John de Mennell de Castle Levington and Newby, brother and
eventually heir oi the Nicholas de Mennell who intrigued with Lucia de
Latimer (nee Thweng). He succeeded his brother in 1322, his wife being
the lady Katherine named in note 3, p. 700. His son, John de Menneu,
Alicia’s father, died before himself, leaving a son, also John de Menuell de
Castle Levington and N ewby, who died 111 13ᾗ8, Α11616 being his heir, as he
had been his grandfather's. At the date of her brother's death Alicia was
twenty-two years oi age, and the wife of John de Boulton, as is known from
the Inq. p. m. of her brother. In 37 Edw. 111. (1263) she was ‘⁴ nuper uxor
Walteri de Boynton’' (Document quoted in Percy Feod.), and gave to John
(16 Percy de Kildale, her future husband necessarily (as well as her third),
certain lands 111 Kildale, the same in point of fact which had been given to
her grandmother by Arnold de Percy. At this time she was about thirty-six
years of age, and probably married John de Percy very shortly after the
execution of the deed just named, which was no doubt a step preliminary to
the intended marriage. The eldest son by this marriage, John, naturally
sueceeded to the Kildale and associated mauors, the second son, William de
Percy de Castle Levington, as naturally inherited his mother’s lands in Castle
Levington and elsewhere.

² From this point the Percy Feodary goes hopelessly astray, and no
dependence at all can be placed on its genealogical statements. N ext in
succession to John de Percy, the husband of Alicia de Mennell, and as their
son and heir, is placed a William de Percy, who is represented as concerned
in 0116 (166(1 dated 8 Henr. vt, as executing another in the 25 Henr. vr„ and
yet 111 the following paragraph as dying 1 Henry 1v., seised of such and such
manors, “ut patet per Inquisitionem,” etc. As already remarked at the
close οἱ the last note, John de Percy de Kildale, husband of Alicia de Menneu,
was succeeded in his family possessions and appellation by his eldest son
John, who might probably be born about 1365-6. Succeeding (though as a
minor) in 1383, 116 presented to Kildale Rectory 111 1407 and possibly in
1436. But that is uncertain. From his wife Elinabeth’s will, dated in
March 1438, it is apparent that he had already sometime since deceased—
she styles herself “quondam uxor Joh. de Percy de Kildale,'' and makes
mention of her sons william and Henry, and her daughter Elizabeth, besides
John, son of John Percy, probably her grandchild, and of John son of Hem-y
Percy, her ‘⁴ filiolus” (or godchild 2), possibly, or more than possibly, another

grandchild.
