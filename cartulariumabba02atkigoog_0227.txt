¹ There· is here, and in the three entries next sncceeding‚ matter of great
uncertainty.'1'wo οἱ these tergus—‘⁴ holfare” and· ⁸-land hering- fare” —are
met with again in No. 590, under the head oi· ‘Portus de whitbyss’
besides yet another—‘⁴ North se fare ”—and Youug’ s questioning suggestion
of· ‘”grouudage as the possible meaning of· ‘holiare'’ (Whitby Pam-ama,
p. 284), οἱ “ North-sea-dues '’ for ‘⁴ northman? aud of “dues ior landing
and selling herrings '³ for “land hering-fare,” suffice to show the perplexity
they occasioned him. lt would almost seem that an approximate solution
of the doubt may depend* on the meaning to be assigned to the clement sare
found in all these terms. In the first place, sare never means ‘dne.’ In
Wedgwood’s words, cognate with ‘⁸ Goth. faran, Ο. Ν. sara, G. falaren, E.
sare, fundamentally‘’ it means ‘⁸ to go, then ιο get on, ιο do, with refenence
ιο the luck wo meet with in our progress through life; ιο sare well or iu,
ιο be prosperous or the contrary, to meet with good or bad entertainment;
and hence sare, entertaiument, food.” In ‘to pay oue’s sare,’ the reference
of course is to the former of these two meninge, and the meaning of sare
in the terma nuder notice must connect either with it or with the sense food
-either with the sense in ‘ way-farer ⁹ or with thatin ‘sumptuous fare) But
independently oi the inference as to which of the two senses must be in-
volved afforded by ‘⁴ lentynfare,” the sense oi journeying (or even the much
later sense oi payment for facilities οἱ jourueying) is altogether inapplicable,
on the ime of it. We are thus thrown upon the conclusion that :sare in
each of the terma in question means food‚ or what is ιο be used as food.
“Herriug-fare” then would mean a supply of food consisting oi herrings,
and ‘⁴ Northseiare '' a supply oi food derived from the North Seag and the
specificatione accompanying the term ‘⁴ Northsefare ’' come in quite
appositely in support oi the inference, for the said ‘fare’ consisted of 628
keliugs and 140 coles and codlynges, the helings being large cod (see Hali.
in v„ who gives an instance from Havelok) and coles the ordinary coal-flsh,
both οἱ which, together with the codlings named, are the produce of the
‘ deep-sea ' or ⁸ N etth-Sea' fishery. It is scarcely necessary ιο say that
tithes of fish taken or brought into Whitby Han-bour by Whitby fishermen
were paid to the Abbot and convent, and No. 374 gives an illustration oi a
practical application of the rule. But it is idle ιο suppose that stranger
fishermen would have nothing to pay on such fish as they caught aud
