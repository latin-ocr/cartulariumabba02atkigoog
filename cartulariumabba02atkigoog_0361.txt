Sir Arnald Percy, sonne 01 Sir William Percy, certene lande in Kildale, “
abuttinge uppon Skitterigge, by dede without date.” These lands also were
among those conveyed to John de Mennell, and Katherine 1118 11110, 88(1
from the magnitude 01 the grant and the provisions of the conveyauce—the
whole gift was ultimately to return to Amaltl de Percy and his heirs in
(1018811 01 1811181 issue 10 the said John and Katharine—it is scarcely pos·
sible to avoid the conclusion that the said Katharine was a very near relative
01 1110 grantor’s‚ and most likely his daughter. Sir Arnold de Percy appears

the inquisition above named, and another by which the same donor gave to

² In No. 464 ‘⁸ D'nus willelmus de Percy, filius Win. de Percy de Kildale,
et J ohanna uxor ejus‚'' quitclaim to Whitby all their right and claim in and
to the advowson 01 1110 chapel 01 sueton, with all its appurtenances. But
no information is given 88 to who the said J ohanna was, nor 88 10 1110 means
by which the said advowson came into the possession 01 080 01 the Kildale
Percys. All that 088 be said on the subject is that it was in the hands 01
1110 Arundel family3 that J ohanna Arundel, the 1881 descendant in the
direct line, and heiress‚ was twice married, 11 801 three times—-first to Roger
de Baius, possibly 10 Hugo (10 Alta Villa (see No. 459, and 8180 No. 225 and
note 1, p. 184), and certainly to Richard Vertdos (see No. 460) ; 11181 811110

nor 11011 long her son, by whatever name he may have been distinguished,
lived, or to whom, on the supposition that he survived 1118 mother, the lord-
ship, his share 01 1110 Bayus inheritance, would next descend. But it cer·
tainly should be observed that, from the date last noted, Agnes Beyus was
a contemporary 01 William de Percy and his wife J ohanna; that she was
one 01 81 least two female heirs 01 30118888 Arundel by her first husband
