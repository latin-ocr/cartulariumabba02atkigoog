² Named in his father’s will (d. 1282), Teu. Ebor. i. 123, and Arohbp.
Neville’s Register, f. 441³.

⁸ The ‘Desoent' places a John de Perey in this generation, but makes
him a younger brother of another William de Pei-oy, who is dealt with as
the elder son, and made to be, as already noticed, the father of Christiana (of
note 2 on last page). He, the said John de Percy, is in reality the eldest son
and heir of the last John de Pei-oy (1 of Generation 11„ and see note 2, p. 703),
who is distinguished from him by the apposition of Senior to his name when
mentioned (Te-vt. Elia. de Percy de Kildale, March 4, 1433). He seems to
have died without a wm, letters of Administration of John Pei-oy de Kildale
‘⁸ qui ob. intest.” having been granted in Feb. 1443 to John and William
anton of Kildale. An Inq. p. m. J oh. de Peroy (of course the same), who
held the Manor of Kildale, one oarucate in Crathorne, landa, ete„ in Kilburn,
at Thirsk, eto„ was held at Thin-sk 22 Henr. vl. (1443). in which John de
Pei-cy, of the age of ten years and upwards, is named as his son and heir.
He presented to Kildah, possibly in 1436, and certainly in 1440.

⁴ In the Inquisitio speoified in the last note, John de Peroy, lately deoeassd,
is stated to have held the Manor of Upsel within the liberty oi Richmond‚
having been enfeoffed therein jointly with Elizabeth his wife, who was
then surviving, by Wiuiam Perey Esquire and Thomas Malbysh.

⁶ An three mentioned in the will of their mother above noticed. It is
almost certain, moreover, that the william de Peroy named in the following
extracta is the William de Perey here particularised :—“ william Sheparde
of Hoton juxta Gisborne did release to this Win. Percy the 7th all his right
and clame that he had in oerten lande and tenements in Kildale‚ by deede
dated 8 Heur. VI. (1438). And after, scil. 25 Henr. vl. (1442), the said Will.
Per-cy gave the landes aforesaid to Will. Parkinson and his heires.’'—(Percy
Feod. Descent.)

⁰ Named in the Inq. p. m. of his father (see note 3, supra) as “ aetatis x
annorum‘’ at that date (1443). He presented to Kildale March 18, 1473, and
appears to have died in 1501. At least there is a will by a John de Perey
of that date (Rey. Test. vi. 3), who gives directions that he be buried ‘⁸ in
medio chori EeoL S. cuthberti de Kildale,’' whose identity with this youth-
ful heir of 1443 it is necessary, rather than only safe, to infer. He mentions
in the said document his sister Elizabeth (her mother and grandmother, as
well as one of her aunts, on our assumption, having also been called by that
name), and another sister Isabella3 and his two sons, Peter and James,
