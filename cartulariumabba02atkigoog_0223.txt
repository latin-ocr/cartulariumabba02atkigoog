¹ There is no apparent philological explanation, or clue to the origin, of this
word. It is apparent that it stands for certain ‘⁸ animalia,’' bnt as to creatures
of what sort, that is matter of question. It may be remarked that sheep and
lambs, oxea, cowe, a calf. and (presumably) a pack·horse, porkers and fatted
boars, together with geese‚ are all named in the catalogue of animale sold. This

narrows the question as to what ‘⁶ pedelakis ” may represent very materially.
consideration of the price obtained for them, whatever they were, narrows

it still further. A “pedelake ” of the better quality fetched ed„ of an in-
ferior character, 4d. The porker eost a shilling, the ‘⁶ frank '² from 16⁸. to
23³. 4d.‚ the ox and eow were severally worth 10⁸. and 8³„ while the sheep
rated at δᾶ. and ls, each, and the lambs at 4d. Fourpence each was also
received for the geese. Itis clear then that the “ 1»edelake'’ was nothing
so insignificant as a ‹luck or a fowl (the latter of which was valued at 2d.,‚
it will be remembered), and there is really nothing in the way of stock that
remsins to be named, except pige just off the mother—in short, if not the
‘⁴ sticking-pig ” of savoury flavour, yet still a newly weaned store-pig. But
there is a further question involved in the name—that is to say, Is the final
portion of it—the syllable or syllables lakes—identieal with the lakes which
are found joined with the words pollinis and ovis ἲ In No. 591 we find, in
the corresponding part of the roll, the item “ de xiii porcellis de pamento,’'
which are valued at between 3d. and 4d. each. May not ‘⁴ pedelakis” be
equivalent to “ porcellis de pamento ’Ἴ “ Decimae porcellorum ” are men-
tioned in No. 291, and “ tithe-pig '' is a household word, and it is a matter
almost of certainty that there were other offerings or dues analogous to, but
over and above, those of fowls and egge, and of probability that the crea-
tures meant by ‘⁶ pedelakis ’² were of that description, and, by the circnm-
stances, are limited to pigs of tender age.
