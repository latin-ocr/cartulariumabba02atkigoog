² See No. 116, and note 2, p. 97, Nc. 165, and note 3, on p. 328. Since
the notes here cited were written, passages in other documents have
been met with tending to throw light enough upon the word ‘ofnam‚ ’

‘ssovenham or ‘hovenam,’ to lead to its explanation. Thus, in the
Rievaulx Chartulary (Cott. msa, Jul. D. 1), at f. 10212, is a charter by
Tot-phin de Alve[r]stein and his son Alan, granting to Rievaulx‘ ‘in
escambium? ‘’ inter αῑία,ι ‘v acras t’rae in Gindala de qfnamn‘s nostris, et ex
parte occid. ipsius vallis xxvi perchatas ad aedificia sua. In tostis quas
fecimus de utlandis dedimus eis tres acras et dimid. perchatam in ipso
qsnamo juxta praedictas v acras t’roe in Gindala.” And again at f. xliii, in
another charter by the same personage, thus curicusly headed, “ Carta
Capituli Sc’i Petri de donatione Torphini de Alvestein de una carrucata t’rae
confirmata in hoc sigillo, quia ipse sigillo carebat‚“ the following clause
occurs—“ Et pro tostis ipsius carrucatae concesserunt eis et dederunt
quinque acras in Gindala de ofnam ipsius Torphini . . . et pro tostis quas
fecit de utlandis dederunt eis tres acras et dimid. perchatam in ipso qfnam,
juxta” etc. Here, in the first place, we have osnam in the plural, ‘⁴ de
ofnamis nostris;” in the second, the fact that one of these ofnams was in
tofts which had been ‘⁸ made ’' or taken up “de utlandis.’' In this district
of Cleveland‚ ‘ inland ’ is the word applied in a certain sort of contradistinc·
tion to lands which are not in, or of, or on the common 3 and portions of
land taken up from the common by sufferance, and in comparatively recent
times, and so, entirely distinct from the ‘ inland’ οι· ancient enclosed land,
are called ‘intaka’ ‘Outland,’ as contrasted with this ‘ inland,' would
mean much what is meant by ‘common ’ in Cleveland at the present day,
the unenclosed land in which every freebolder has an equal proportionate
right with the lord himself, so far as pasturage, tut-bary, etc. etc„ are
concerned. It is hardly likely that a different state of things would prevail
at the place indicated above, that is Gindale‚ and the inference is that the
ofnams named in these Rievaulx deeds were simply ‘ intaks,’ or enclosures
from the common made by the lord himself. One other consideration may
tend to establish this view. The whole of the Cleveland district, with only
small exceptione, was not only occupied, but named (or re-named‚ perhaps)
by the Danes and Northmen, and, as might be expected, the dialect-words
of the district are Scandinavian to a very remarkable extent indeed. One
among them is this very word ⁸ intak,’ the parallel to which in old
