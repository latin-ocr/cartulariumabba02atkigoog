² “Planca, Planqa. Tabula in qua merces venum exponuntur3 mercatorum
sedes et apothecae.” In a charter of 1058, edited by Muratori (tom. i.
Anciq. Ital. med. oevi, coll. 190)-“ Concedimus iu eodem Archiep'is ut
quando tu et successores tui et pars jamdicti Archiep’ii volueritis intra
ipsas terras et casas (written cavas) et potechas (pro apothecas, as explained
in v.) in ipsa platea, planyas secus eas ponere faciatis et habere quantas
volueritis, et in ea lignamina rigere et habere, et super eas edificia qualiter
volueritis, et in ipsis terris et casis et potechis et plancis, quot volueritis
homines ordinare licentiam habeatis, et carnes et alia mercimonia iu eis
mercimoniare et vendere et emere, quantas tibi tuisque success. et pars ipsius
Archiep'ii placuerit. Rammium—Species tributi quod pro planchis exsolvi·
tur.”—(Ducange.) But the “ plankage '’ of the text was scarcely of this nature,
as will be seen on consideration of the terms of the award given as stated
below :—“ Les dits Abbe et Covent averount plankage—cest asavoir, quatre
deniers pour son plank des estraungers, et, pour les vessealx des Burgeois
meismes, les Burgeoises averont lour plankes propres fraunehemmt, ou
autrement le plank [de l] Abbe saunz rien paier pour ycelle ;” for from this
it is apparent that not only had the Abbot his own private ‘plank’ but
that the planks were connected with the shipping trading to the port. The
alternative meaning would therefore seem to be a payment or consideration
rendered for the privilege of laying out a plank as a gangway or means of
passage from the vessel to the shore. Such a conclusion would be in strict
consistence with what is known oi the exercise of similar rights or fran-
chises in the same district. Thus, to speak of but one case, it is known from
the Inq. p. m. of Peter de Brus 111„ and divers other like documenta con·
nected with his successore in title at Skelton (Fauconbergs, Thwengn,
Fanacourts, Lumleys) down to 1500 and later, that, inter alia, the following
rights and franchises were comprised in the appurtenances oi the Manor of
Skelton with its member Marske—l. J urisdietion over fisheries in the
waters of Tees. 2. Court for the scrutiny oi nets on the waters of Tees.
3. Dues for anchorago and tolls pro situ navis (ἲ groundage) at Cotum. 4.
Ferry·tolls at Mellods and Blakescore (or Blakeshire) in Kirkleatham.
5. Tolls for the passage of the waters of Tees (elsewhere than at the ferries
named, presumably). All of these matters were sources of revenue, and in
strict accordance with the practice of exacting payment for the privilege of
anchoriug‚ or the resting of a vessel on the beach or river-bed, would be
that of plankage, explained as above.

³ Doubtless a corrupt form of pierres.
