being most likely a literal translation of what is now- the dialect word,
snubbinq, mapingz, mibbiny. Ο. Ν. snubba, Dan. snubbe, both mean to cut
short, to lop or trim ; Clevel. snaps or &neap has the same signification,
while snib is a word applied to the removal of the “ tops and tails” of goose·
berries; and trees, etc„ cut back by wind, frost, or the pruning-knife, are
said to be sraubbed, all these forms representing also the sense implied in
culpare. But note also Fr. couper, Ο. Fr. colper, to cut.

¹ See note 2 to No. 446, supra.

² See note 3 to No. 446, supra. Notwithstanding Charlton's positive
identification of this place, it has never appeared to be quite satisfactory. At
p. 398 it will be seen that it is mentioned, as here, in connection with ‘⁶ Le
Ker,'’ and with Aselby, Baldeby, Stakesby—all of them places on the west
side of the Esk. Young, whom it is safer to follow than Charltom also iden·
tifies Sourebi as the latter does (p. 889), but without alleging any authority.
The Domesday connection of Sourebi with Prestebi iu the mention made of
the Abbot of York’s interest in these rolls may'seem to indicate a relative
mutual vicinity, but apart from any distinct evidence to the fact, it cannot
go for much. Almost clearly it lay somewhere not far out of the line be·
tween the Carrs and Baldby Fields.

³ This is clearly the locality indicated by the name Laghscog, Lagh'scogh’,
at pp. 390, 398, and there is scarcely a doubt that it lies in the vicinity of
what is here named Newhamdale—the valley through which Newbam-beck
flows, necessarily. It is quite possible that the modern name Ewecot is a
corrupted sur-vival of Labiscot.
