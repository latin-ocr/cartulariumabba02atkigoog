² The exact descent of this grantor is not, 1 think, anywhere distinctly
stated; but there can be little doubt about it. For it is clear he is a
descendant of Reginald and Alan Buscel, inasmuch as he speaks of them as
his “antecessores in Hotona.'’ It will be remembered (see No. 75, note 4,
p. 69) that Aaliza de Percy's second husband was Reginald Buscel, by
whom she had issue Alan Buscel, wh0‚ temp. Stephen, gave the church of
Hoton Buscel to Whitby. This Alan had a son Alan, who confirms his
father’s grants in No. 241, and is witness to No, 252. Τ116 william Buscel,
who appears so repeatedly as a witness to charters contained in vol. i. (see
Nos. 31, 87, 155, 156, 168, 172, 177, 178, 179, etc), is probably, with his
brother Robert (also named in No. 179), son of this second Alan, and father
of the present grantor3 an assumption which considerations as to date
sufficiently tend to confirm, the date of the present charter- being approxi-
mately settled by the presence of the name of Nicholas de Hastinges as a
witness to the one which succeeds it, and so closely, in many respectu,
reproduces it. See N 0. 524.
