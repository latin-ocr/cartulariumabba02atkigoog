‘⁸ originally of worldly position and influence,” and, besides that, with s
developed cspscity for the rule of s monastic institution (see p. lxxi). It is
further very far indeed from unlikely thst he did sspire to succeed to the
Priorste on the untimely decesse of Reinfrid, and that he would be dis-
appointed by the natural, not to say inevitsble, preference of a member of
the Founder’s house to himself. If it were so, it would be a strong
additional reason for his selection ss the head of the body of monks who
were deputed to commence and orgenise the monastic settlement “in
honorem B. Msrioe ” st York3 and if it were not so, still his recognized
fitness and capacity, sud from both points of view—the Seculsr snd the
Religionis-might and would be amply sufficient ιο induce his appointment
ns their lesder and superior. Possibly even some slight suggestion of s
resson for the fact involved in “the perplexing entry in Domesdsy ''
(p. lxxi.) may also be derived from the same οι· similer considerations. As
deputed head of such sn emigrating body of monks sn arrangement—quite
possibly intended to be, ss the event proved it to be, s. temporsry arrange-
ment—ss to Prestebi and Sonrebi might be mede, to which William de
Perci and his brother, Serlo, the new Prior, were consenting parties, as well
ss Stephen himself. No. 555 establishes the fect that Serlo de Perci had
become Prior by or before 1087 (as Nos. 27 snd 579 do that he wss still
Prior up to, presumably, about 1095). It was shortly before the demise of
william the Conqueror that Esrl Alsn of Bretsgne is represented as grant·
ing to Stephen snd his followers the newly-constructed church of S. Olsvc,
and Stephen ss svsiling himself of the grant—in his own terms, yielding to
the sweet persuasione (dulciter persuasit) oi the grnntor. And then—
“ post non multum vero tempus ”-William the conqueror dies, william
Rufus succeeds, and within the first year of his reign the foundation of the
actual St. Msry’s becomes an accomplished fect. This singular coincidence
in point of time between Serlo’s accession to the Priorate and william de
Perci’s consequent enlnrged endowment of the Whitby House (fully con·
firmed by the conqueror’s second charter), and Stephen’s entrance upon his
work st S. Oleve’s, with its consummation in the transactions of the follow·
ing yesr, is surely worthy of distinct attention. So that on the whole it
may well seem that the statement from the Chronica de Melea commented
upon in this note is one of singqu interest snd importunes in endeavour-ing
to delineate the early history of the monastery of Whitby. Another con·
sideration srising, not unnatnrffly, out of s remark made above—to the
effect thet it would be idle to suppose Symeon of Durhsm meent to imply
thst the monks in s body left Whithy, so that the monastery there was
entirely forsaken—may here not insptly be mentioned. At p. lxxxvi. the
possibility, or more, oi some tempornry check or checks to the prosperity oi
the renascent monastery, such ss to “ compel a temporsry retrest to the
Hsckness cell,’' is glsnced at. There is no historical doubt thst such s
retreat did tske place, and that it took place while the Community was pre-
sided over by θοι-10. Tanner and Dodsworth both note “sn agreement
