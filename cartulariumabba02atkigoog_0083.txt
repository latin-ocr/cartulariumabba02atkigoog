⁴ The connection of “les amendes de lassise (16 payne enfreignt‚” etc„ and
“infangenthef‚'’ are so far interesting 63 to deserve special notice. ‘⁴ The
best definition of the franchise of Infangenthef occurs at p. 518 (Ρῑασίια de quo
warranto, ed. Record Commission)‚ the more valuable because given on
behalf of the Crown. The Abbot of Croyland claims gallows and Infangen-
thei, in his manor of Wellingborougb,—- ‘ and as to gallows,’ he says that ⁴ he
has Infangentbef in that 11161101, 611(1 11161 116 61611113 to have gallows‚ “quae
616111 judiciales et penales,” for the execution of pleae of the Crown in 1113
11161101· aforesaid, by occasion of the liberty aforesaid, and by that warrant
he claime to have the aforesaid gallows in his manor. And as to Tumbril
and Pium-y, 116 says that he 1163 6 view of frankpledge‚ to which appertains
the custody of the assize of bread and beer, and because the aforesaid
Tumbril and Pillory were found for this (invente ad hoc), that trans·
gressors of the assiae aforesaid might be conformably punished—to wit,
by the aforesaid Tumbril for breaking the assize of beer, and by the
aforesaid Pillory for the assize of bread not observed. And by that wat-rant
he claims to have “judicialia predicta ’' for lawfully punishing such trans-
gressore accord-ing to the laws and customs of the kingdom of England.’
The King's attorney replies‚ and says that, 63 to Infangenthef, the Abbot
ought not to enjoy it, because he, the attorney, says that ‘the liberty of
Infangenthef 13 6 certain royal jurisdiction belonging to the Crown, attribut-
ing power to judge 6 10111161· or thief taken with the mainour within che lord-
