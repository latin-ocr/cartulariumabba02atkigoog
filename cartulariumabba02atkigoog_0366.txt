¹ See 1661 11016. The ‘ Descent‘ in the Percy Feodary brings in here a
John de Percy, 6011 of John de Percy, aon of John and Elizabeth (the latter
the lady of the will of 1438), and attributes 1ο him the parentage of four
daughters, viz„ ‘⁴ 16611611 Perey, J 06116 marr. 10 Will. Bulmer, Gent„ Alice
marr. 10 Μ1. Wateon, and Elizabeth Percy,'’ and adde “ 111666 4 daughters and
co·heirea grannted and sonld 10 Henrie Lo. Percy, Erle of Nerthumberland,
and to hie 1161166 1116 mant of Kildale with the appartenauncee, and all there
landes and tenements in Kildale or elsewhere in the County of York, by
there 66161611 (16(166 dated in the 66161611 yerea of Henry vn„ viz„ the ἰχῶ,
xviim and xviiith yerea, 66 by a Booke οἱ 1116 Lo, Euidencee may appeare.”
Upon thia it may be remarked that it 16 scarcely to be regarded 66 incon-
sistent with the will of John de Percy de Kildale dated in 1501. Aa in
601116 former 1116166066, 1116 heir ‘⁴ in feudo et haereditate'' may not be named
at all, and besides the two 60116 11110 616 named, Peter and James, it 16 by
110 11166116 impossible, or even improbable, that there may have been 611
elder 6011 John with 166116 four daughters only. This 16 6 111616 conjecture,
but it 16 1101 rendered 1666 likely by 1116 coincidence, almost rather than
correspondence‚ of the date of the completion of the alleged 6616 111111 11161
of the will, and by the certain fact that the Kildale Manor, etc„ with the
Advoweon of the Chnrch did paee into the hande οἱ 1116 Northnmberland
family very shortly after the date of the said will.
