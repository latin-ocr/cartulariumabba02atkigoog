Ricardi de Bradelay, pro hom. et serV. suo, unum mesuagium et
triginta acras t’rae et dim. in v, et t'ritorio de Deles, et tres
acras t’rae et dim. in campo de Brokesay—Illud scil. mes„ et
illas acr. t'rae‚ quae Thomas Overthebek quondam tenuit,
quarum in tofto et crofto sunt quatuordecim acrae et dim„
secundum quod jacet in longitudine et latitudine de Lange-
dalebek² usque ad t'ram Roberti (19 Dales,⁸ et sic sub Brader-

field adjacent to the house. Skinner: and see Spelman in v. Curtilagium,”
with two examples from “ The Boke qs Tulle of Old Aye, Caxton, 1481,'' the
second of which is, ‘⁸ How grete delectacyons and playser is had in gardynes
and curtilaqea graffed with trees.'' Neither Skeat nor Wedgwood noticee the
word, aa was to be foreseen. It doubtleee depende on old Fr. court, cort,
whence mod. Fr. cour, a courtward). “ Acceptions du terme en bau·
latin‚” says Scheler, “ sont ε l. cour de maison, ferme, metuit-ie, basce-
cour 3—de Ῑὲ, les derives : courtzl, Β L„ curtile, Wallon corti, jardin dependant
d’une habitation rurale‚” whence by the substitution of the frequent Low
Latin termination avium, for e, in curtile, we have the word curtilaqium-.

¹ The name of the first witness fixes the approximate date of the chartei·
(see No. 22, dated 1270, and No. 320, dated 1268), and settles the identity
of this Abbot‚ Robert de Langtoft having precided over the Abbey from
c. 1265-1278.

² It is not easy to say where and what the beck thus named was and is.
The river Derwent itself runs past Langdale End both High and Low, and
precludes the idea that thie Langdalc can be the Langdale through which
that river runs. From the occurrence of the name Braderheved just below,
it is not impossible that the Langdale of this deod may be the Dale which,
as may be seen in the Ordnance Survey‚ is noW, so to speak, severed into the
two parte, Low Dales and High Deles, and the more so because in Nos, 276,
300, the territorial title is ‘⁸ de Dales‚” and the locality eo designatod must
surely, in reason, be identified with Langdale.
