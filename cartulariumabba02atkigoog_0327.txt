¹ These entries are of interest principally as showing the continuance of
the vacancy in the Abbey after the death of Abbot Peter 1., who is said to
have deceased in 1211. The interdict had been laid on the land in 1208 ;
in 1212 John was deposed ς in 1213 he conceded the kingdom to the Pope ;
and in 1214 freedom of election to churches was granted. ‘⁴ The right of the
chapters to elect their bishops, and of the monasteries to elect their abbots,
although strictly canonical, had long been lost sight of in England. In the
eighth and ninth centuries several cases of election to bishoprics may be
found, in which, the national church being stronger than the heptarchic king,
the choice was probably free. But under the west-Saxon kings the appoint-
ments were generally made in the Witenagemot, and under the Normans by
the king in his great courts. The form of election was restored under
Henry 1.‚ . . . but the process took place under the eye of the king or justi-
ciar, and was only nominally free. This was (taken in connection with the
royal claims to the revenue of a see during its vacancy, a vacancy which the
king could prolong at his pleasure) a very heavy grievance, and it was pro-
bably with a view of propitiating Archbishop Langton that the reform was
now proposed.''—(Stubbs‚ Select Char-cers, 288.) That the vaeancy at Whitby
was prolonged‚ among so many other cases, need therefore occasion little sur·
prise. See Yonng’s Whitby, p. 264. This author states that the vacancy lasted
three years, and that John of Evesham was appointed Abbot by Nicholas,
the Pope’s Legate; his authority appear-ing to be a statement by Oharlton
(p. 157), to the effect that the said Legate ‘⁶ made a progress through the
greatest part of England to inquire what bishoprics, abbeys, beneficos and
church·livings were then vacant, all of which he filled up, and bestowed on
such ecclesiastics as he thought proper, without either the king or Stephen
Langton, who was then Archbishop of Canterbury. In his round he
appointed an ecclesiastic, called John of Evesham, to be Abbot of Whitby,
and ordered all the revenues and possessione of the monks there to be
restored, the same ae in the days of the abbot Peter, leaving them established
in peace, and fortified with his charter, almost equal in validity to one of
his master-’s bulls” z—Charlton's own authority for all this being, as usual,
his own ipse daie.
