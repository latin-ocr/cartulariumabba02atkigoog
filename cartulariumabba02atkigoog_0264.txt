¹ Dr. Young here gives 3 reference to 3 former page (325) of his H'oetory,
on turning to which, we find 3 notice of the law-enit between Peter de
Mauley 111. and the convent, and in 3 note (p. 327) what followe 2-“Thie
iniquitone attach on their property wne attended with great expense to the
monke; for in the Roll of Expenditnre ior 1394-5, 13 this entry, ‘ It. in ex-
pensis, etc.,’ 33 above. So that the trial cont them near 1:45, though their
adversaries were condemned to pay the expensas-’¹ Other remarks follow,
and one 13 that “the final decieion was delayed till eleven years after the
examination now related‚” etc. The blundering here 13 moet extraordinnry
and outrageoue. The date of the settlement of the dispnte was 1283, and
13 eo stated by Young himself (p. 325), end thie item in the diebnreemente 13
entered in 3 roll belonging to 1391, not 11 but. 111 years afterwards! What
thie new “ cauea '' between the Rector of Lythe and the convent at the end
of the fourteenth century may have been, there 13 at present no evidence to
show.

Cleveland form 13 fleeak, which 13 the pronunciation either of flake or flook

Glooeary the form given 13 “flues, pronounced fleake orfleeakc.”
