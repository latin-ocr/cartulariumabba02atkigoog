he called 1110 1111100 vi ee ιιι-11110 ; on which the Abbot and Convent of

accordingly restored, but a prosecution was commenced by him against the
Abbot and Convent of Whithy, wherein he claimed not only the before-
mentioued tithes, but 0100 1110 pai-ish church of St. Mary itself, situate near
the Abbey gates, 0000111118 11 10 110 subordinate to and dependent 011 his
par-ish church at Lyth. The cause being tried at common law before spiritual
11111800, 0 vet-dict was gained against John of Tocotes ς 11111 110, not satisfied
11101οπ1111, appealed to Rome, on which his 1101111000 issued a Bon, wherein
he appointed judge-delegates here in Yorkshire to inquire into the affair, and
to give him a faithful account 11101001. Hereupon a commission was held
about Candlemas‚ anno 1283, and the depositione of many witnesses were
taken, viz. , ou behalf of the Abbot and Convent of Whitby, those of Geoffrey
Penoc of Whitby‚ aged 49 years; of Andrew Scot, 111-1001 of St. Mary's at
Whitby, aged 50 years ς of Lawrence, a blacksmith in Whitby, aged 80

of Robert, the 0011 of Walter of Whitby, aged 60 years ; and of Henry, the
son of Alan of Whitby, aged 0100 60 years. Every one of these being
separately examined, deposed, That Thordesay Beck, which issued out of
Mulgrave Park, was the western limit of Whitby parish ; that the bounder
went from thence to Methone, near the corner of the Horsecroft; from
thence to Swarthouecross, and from thence right down Brocholey Beck to
the river Eske: That it was public, notorious, and manifest to all those who
lived in Whitby Strand, that the Church of St. Mai-y at Whitby had for time
immemorial, and 00 they verily believed from 110 first foundation, belonged
to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby, who in right thereos had ever received
tithes from all these places which were now claimed by John of Tocotes and
Lord Peter de Malo-lacu. On the contrary, John of Tocotes' witnesses swore
positively that the manor of Mulgrave extended to the river Eske ; but not
being able to disprove the premises now in disputo being in the possession of
the Abbot and convent of Whitby, they deposed, That, some ages before

to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby‚ wh0, 011 account of that mortgage, had
