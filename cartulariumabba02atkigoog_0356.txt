DCXLI. (From the Pei-cy Feodary.)

{⁹² descent of the Percyes of Kildale according to ancyent
Θηῗθῐῖιῖῗιῗᾙαῐη de Percy, came in with Wffliam [the] Con-
queror.

11. Allan de Percy.

ΙΙΙ. 1. Walter Percye, lord of Kildale, tempore Henr. 1.⁸

4. Gerfraye Percye3 iiii‘u‘ filius,

¹ As several references have been msde to this question in the preceding
peges, and as the published Pedigrees of Percy of Kildale, of which Ord’s
(Hice. qt* Glcveland, 426) may be taken as a fair sample, are beyond doubt
utterly erroneous, it has been thought better to insert a short notice of the
true descent of that family, with the requisite proofs.

² The pedigree is in the form of a descending stem with circles on either
side, one to receive the name of the man, the other that of his wife, and
from side-lines on either side oi the main stem depend other circles, to re·
eeive the names of the issue, so arranged that. the son through whom the
descent continues is always nearest the descending stem, and to his circle is
united another by a eroes-bar, for his wife's name. In the text 1 merely
give the contente of the said cii-cles, numbering them where necessary, ss in
the preceding genealogical notes, down to the point at which the Kildalo
family is supposed to branch off from the main family. Allowing for the
expansione, what is printed above is an exact copy. On either side of the
stem with its eii-cles, and in the horizontal interspaces between the circles
are notes, comments, and extrects from chat-tere, etc„ illustrative of the
acts or history of the several persons more prominently named.

³ The side-note to this personage's circle is :—

mnne. This Walter was βοῇ-ἀ] of Kildale and Ormesby and others
about the time of King Hem-y 1., and was 2[nd] senne to Allane, Lo. Percy,
and Emme, his wife, daughter to Gilbert de Gnate, Erle of Kyme and Bai-ron
of 'rinsley in Lincolnshire.
