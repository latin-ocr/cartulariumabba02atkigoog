¹ Ricardus de Percy 1. de Dunseley died before 1148, and was succeeded
by his eon william, who bae grant of Dunsley from Abbot Benedici: as fully
and freely as his father had held it (No. 265). This William de Percy de
Dunsley in Nc. 74 entreats his heir—“ precor haeredem meum, sicut meus
est filius ² ’—to see to the fulfilment of his intentione expreseed in the char-ter,
and among the witnessee to it are named “ Bartolomeus et Hugo haerede8,”
together with the donor'a mother, Atheliza‚ and his sistere Celestris aud
christina. But it ie not certain that either Bartholomew or Hugo was the
“ heir ” adjured in the body of the deed. Now there was a Richard de
Percy de Dunsley living within the first quarter of the thirteenth century,
ae is apparent from No. 254, dating between 1214 aud 1220. Again, in
No, 181 William de Percy de Duneley is named among the witnesses, and is
therefore contemporary with Abbot Roget (1223-1244). Then again we
have a Richard de Percy de Dunseley, presumably a contemporary with
Gawayn de Thweng, Rector of Kirkleatham (who executed deeds aa early
ae 1280 [Harl. mss. 1985, p. 2691, and as late ae 1326 [see next deed, No.
436, and also note to Nc. 14, vol. i. p. 19]). He is, most likely, identical
with the Richard de Percy named among the witnessee to Nc. 22, a deed
dated in 1270; while, in reference to the above presumption, it is to be
remarked that among the witnesses to the deed by John Hersand (printed in
the note to No. 14, just cited) ie a Robert, son of william de Percy, neces-
sarily ‘⁶ de Dunsley '' from the tenor of the deed. Probably, therefore,
assuming Richard de Percy of 1270 and later, to be a son of William de
Percy of Abbot Roger's time, this Robert laet named ia a brother of the
said Richard's. We have then a william de Percy de Dunsley witness to
No. 356, a deed datedin 1305. In No, 439, dated 1308, ancl again in No. 437,
dated 1326, Symon de Percy filius Will. de Percy de Dunseley (or Donele)—
obviously the will. de Percy last named, living in 1305—quitclaims to
Whitby rights and lande in Eskedale, Dunsley, etc„ and finally, in No. 308
