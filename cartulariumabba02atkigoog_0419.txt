fectly explains as ‘a farm-yard,’ giving Y orkslzire 99 119 10091 119111191109.
In the Olet-claud Glossary it 19 defined as “the 9119 09 which a house stands,
or 1199 formerly stood.” This 19 correct 99 far as it goes: but it should be
understood 99 limited 10 1119 9119 of a house of sufficiently ancient date to
carry with it what are called common rights 3 in other words, the burden of
1119 ‘ 011111 pertinenciis ’ ol 911011 perpetual occurrence in ancient charters. It
will be observed that in the text it is made synonymous 111111 tuit—i fronte
sive toftum‚-and the toft was simply and specially the site of 9 1101199,
carrying 111111 11, whether ‘ aedificatnm’ or ‘ nonaediflcatum,’ all the rights,
privileges, 9999199919, 910., implied in the phrase ‘ cnm pertinenciis! My
attention was first drawn to the word 91019 11199 thirty years ago by 99 01(1
official of the Manor here, who told me of a ⁶ frontstead ’ on what 19 now the
common or unenclosed moor; and 09 my mentioning it to the late Lord of
the Manet, 119 directed that 9 note should be made of it as of an important
fact. In one respect—that 19, 99 regarded in connection 111111 1119 ancient
history of the district-it has proved an interesting fact. In a fine of 1242
between the Prior ol Gyseburne and the regnant Peter de Brus, a launda 19
named 99 91111919 19 1119 Park of Danby 91 9 part called Sontesby. This
name still existe in the form Sowerby, and the locality 19 distinguished by
the remains of the old 9901099199, and 9190 by what explains the fact of
there being a laurada there-namely‚ the evident indicia of ancient iron-
working on the spot. Donbtless one of the five small forfice named in Inq.
p. m. P. de Brus 111, and described 99 of little 191119 011193 10 1119 destruction
of the forest—cut down and used up in the past 9111911193 operatione—had
been located there.
