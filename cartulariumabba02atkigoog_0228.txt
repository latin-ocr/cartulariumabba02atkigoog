brought into ροτις and aa all these Ῑιιγιιιειιιε, aa well ne those of tithe,
would naturally and necessarily be paid in kind, there mnet have been a
large etock wcumulated from time ιο time in the Abbey ‘fieb-houee’ (or
‘ houeee'). And probably (ιιοι ιο say almost certainly) the ‘Nortlmefar-e’
and ⁴ hei-ingrate ' enti-ie· depend on the sales oi pert of the said etoek. The
term ‘land-heringfare ’ thus ιι οιιοο assumes a definitae and reasonable
meaning z—viz. duee pnid in kind on catches of herting ⁶ landed’ at Whitby.
Ae ιο the phrase ‘herting-fare) 1 would edd that ἰι ie not οιιι of noe in
whitby even yet. ΜΓ. F. K. Robinson, author of the Whitby Gla-emm, iu·
formed me a few years back that he etin heard ἰι from time ιο time, in some
euch form ae “ no laclt of hem-inqsare,'’ ‘⁸ a vast of henim-sare? in connec-
tion with large taken οἱ the fieh in question. “ Lentynfare ” and “ winter-
fare '’ explain themselves, ns being most likely dependent on the offen-inge of
different kinds oi provisione made at those senone of the year ιο ecelesias·
tical persons and bodies by pariehionere md dependente, Bauer-duee end
Yule0tide or Chrietmae duee would all be paid in kind ior long, and great
accumulatione in the cnse oi a House like the Abbey would ensue. Ae
ιο the meaning oi ‘haltere' or ‘helian-est 1 am unable ιο offer any ex-
planation.

¹ Inferior grain falling away from the better and weightier corn in the
pragi-ese of ⁸ dreesingz' ιο thia day called in eleveland ‘ offal-corn‚'
⁸ offel ’ itaelf depending on two words, off and sall (see Skent, Etym. Dice.
in v.). The equivalent word in more southerly districts ie ‘teil-corn?
There ie etill a third description of grain reenlting from the process of
‘drawing' usually called here ‘hen-meat,' and by Halliwell (under 'rail-
corn) “drusa'’ οι· “ undercorn,'’ which he describes ns “ eo light and inferior
aa to be given ιο poultry.'‘
