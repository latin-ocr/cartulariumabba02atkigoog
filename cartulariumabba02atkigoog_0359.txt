CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 699

ΙΙΙ. 1. Willelmus de Percy, filius Roberti de Percy, filii
Ernaldi 1. de Percy :¹ m. Agnes (de Flammavilla)‚ widow of
„J ohannes de Birkin.2

2. 2 Hugo de Percy.

3. 2Henricu5.

¹ Willelmus de Percy, “d. c. et conf. Deo et Eccl. S. Mariae (18 Gysburnia,”
all his right in the Churches of Ormesby and Orathorne, and the mill οἱ
“ Kaldecotes, “sicut in cartis Ernulfi (18 Percy, avi mei, 8ι Ernulfi avunculi
mei continetur. ”—(Gysb. Chart. f. ι2151).)

Will. de Percy (18 Kildale . . “pro salute animae Agnetis, uxoris meae”
confirms“ omnem donationem quam Robertus de Brus dedit eis de feodo
Ernulfi de Percy avi mei.”

Will. de Percy, specifically ‘de Kildale‚' is then nephew oi Ernald de
Percy and grandson oi the first Ernald, and necessarily therefore son of
Robert, Ernald’s brother. But there were more children to Robert than
only this William; ior in 16 Heni-y 11. Adam de Brus (11.) “ r. c. de 250
marcis pro haeredibus Roberti de Brus quos habet in custodia sua, pro
habenda terra Ernaldi avunculi sui,'’ while Ernaldus himself (11 Henr. 11.),
“ r. c. de 100 marcis pro recto habendo de Ada de Brus,'' it being clear thus
that he died between 1165 and 1170. Who these heirs were besides William
de Percy is not apparent. A Hugo, nephew oi Walter de Percy, son of the
present william, is mentioned in a Gysburne chat-ter by the former, in which
he confirms his father's gifts. of course he may have been a nephew on the
mother’s si‹1e; but it should be remarked that in the Percy Feodary a Hughe
Percye is put by the side of Will. (18 Percy οἱ 1197. A William de Percy
junior is also named in the same series of charters, who is probably identical
with Willelmus fil. Ernaldi de Percy, who is met with twice as a witness,
and who may have been illegitimate or a priest. There is also a Henry de
Percy named as a witness to the confirmation by william de Percy de
Kildale specially noted above. He may have been a son oi Robert’s and
brother of the grantor. From a Conventio between this william (18 Percy
de Kildale and the Canons of Gysburne “in curia Adae de Brus iactast (Gysb.
Chart. ἱ. 215b) it is ascertained that he was still living in 1197 (which is ’
its date), William de Percy, junior, also being a witness. ·
