cion del auncien chartre faite el ² temps Abbe Richard :—

¹ There is a good deal of uncertainty as to this word. It is met with
again in the Account Roll, printed as Nc. 590, in the form wn‘dels. Young,
who in the Whitby Panorama (pp. 20-25, and 283-285) gives a copy of this
document, reads spirdele, and suggests inquiringly ‘ spat-deals ' as the
meaning. See also his Hister-y qt· Whitby (p. 921), where the same is to be
noted. The phrase here occurring in its entirety, “spredeles de retem
would entirely do away with that suggestion, even were it greatly more
tenable in itself. Still what ⁴ spridels of nets ' may be remains to be inquired.
The decision as to this matter of disputo between the Abbey and the
Burgesses‚ as given below (p. 505), is—“Item quant as spridels, nul altre
les doit avoir si non labbe et Covent, fois tout seulement solone la quantite et
rate del porcioun qest occupie3 de lour {ranke tenement ;” or, no one has any
right to them save the Abbot and Convent alone, and they only according to
the quantity and proportion of their free tenement actually occupied. As
will be seen below (Account Roll, No. 590), one small source of income to
the Abbey was due to “pendentia retium‚” which, as it appears, probably
had to do with the taking of fish (see note to No. 590). It is scarcely
likely that “spredeles de rete3 '’ has any connection with the “pendentia
retium‚” as the Burgesses could hardly dispute any fishery franchise belong-
ing to the Abbot and Convent. The only suggestion that can be made in
the absence of more definite information is derived from observation of the
practice of the fishermen, particularly those engaged in the herring fishery,
to take their nets (and not only at Whitby, but at Staithes and elsewhere
along the coast) as opportunity, or the exigencies of the fishery, may allow,
and spread them out to dry. Many acres of ground may from time to time
be seen covered with neta in this way. At Staithes the nets are spread on
what is common-land, but at Whitby no common-land now remains, and
an acknowledgmena as paid at all, must be paid to the owner or occupant
of the land made use of. In all probability the use of the abounding
common of the olden time would be hedged about with fines or the pay-
ment of acknowledgments by all users, save only the free men oi the vin,
'and in this way a fine most likely was leviable in all cases where nets were
spread to dry by other than free men of the viu, and this fine 'might be
called spredele. No objection to this theory can easily be alleged on the
ground of its being inconsistent with the apparent derivation of the word:
spred and dele, the latter as in wandala, wandel, vandala, wandaila, etc., and
the former a form oi the participle of spraeden, occurring in the Ormulum.
