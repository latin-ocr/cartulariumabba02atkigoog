¹ pe'cia ναῖ’. To be read no doubt as in the text. Young translates it
“net-money <dues for fishing·nets),” of course mistakenly, if the reading
adopted is correct: and that it is may be with some confidence inferred
from two entries in a rent-roll of Gysburne Prior-y, belonging to Admiral
Chaloner, which, it is hoped, will be printed in the Gysburne Chai-tulary.
They occur under the local heading of Thermodeby (now Thornahy, near
Stockton), and are as follows 2-“Pro retibus pendendis apud Hauchbanc.

. . iiii02’ salmones, vel eorum pretium= inter Puris. B. Marioe et Diem pal-
marum solvendos‚’' and “Pro retibus pendentiis in Mandale,” with a like
payment. There can be little or no question that these enti-ies refer to nets
used in the salmon-fishery in the Tees, and that the nets were stake-nets—
nets which are suspended, or hung by aid of the so-called ⁴ stakes) There
can be equally little doubt that salmon and salmon-trout abounded in the
ΕΘΚ 1ιι 11ιΘ middle ages—they teem even now—and thus nets like the
suspended neta of the Tees would be in use in the lower reaches of the
Whitby river also·

² What the laqena of herrings may have been is uncertain. A last con-
sisted (and consiste) of 10, 000, and the price for good herring seems to have
varied between about 24 and 25, that is, from 8⁸. to lon. per thousand.
These ‘lagenae’ are valued at something over ls. each, and may be supposed
therefore to have contained about 100 to 125. Dr. Young construes the word
⁸ l›arrels,’ without comment. But 11 must have been a very small bai-rel to
contain only so many herrings. Quite possibly it may have been a quarter,
or even a less portion of a ‘barreL' Note the word ‘⁸ kympe’' in No. 6133.

⁸ This is the same as “mixtilis,” in No· 589, p. 566, but the English
word or name employed instead of the Latin translation. 'she word
blendeorn, for wheat and rye mixed, is still 1ιι use in the district, though
the growtli of the crop has nearly or quite ceased. Cf. Sw, Dial. blamlkorn‚
mixed rye and oats, Dan. blandkorn, meslin.
