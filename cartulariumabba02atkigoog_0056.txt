396 CAR'I'ULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

quietum, et integre protestor esse pacatum, exceptioni non
numeratae, non solutae et non traditae mihi pecuniae penitus
renunciando 2—1ta scil„ quod nec ego, Petrus, nec haer. mei,
seu executores mei, nec aliquis alius nomine mec, aliquid jus

 

were examined on behslf of the Abbot and Convent of Whithy, viz..
, nged 75 years ς --, sged 60 years ; Robert Theules of
Whitby‚ sged 50 years ς John de Lsmb of Ryswsrp, nged 40 yesi-⁸5
william, son of John of Risewsrp, aged 50 years 3 Ralph, son oi Alsn of
Sneton, aged 30 years 3 Adam of Harewod, in Whitby Str-and, sged 30 years;
Astine, a monk st Whithy‚ of nineteen yesrs’ standing3 waliam, son of
Oshern of Dunseley, sged 40 years ; and Geoffrey oi Hakenes, sged 48 years.
All these witnesses swore positively that the premises now in dispute were
the fee or frechold of Percy, and, as they verily believed, were given ΒΥ the
first william de Percy and his son Alan to Whitby Abbey 3 snd that they
had never heard it so much as surmised before that they were st any time
mortgnged to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby by william Fosssrd or any
other that possessed the manor of Mnlgrsve, seeing the charters and reeords
in the possession of the said Abbot snd Convent bore direct witness to the
contrary.

‘⁴ A fsir copy of all these depositione and proceedings being made out and
sent to Rome, a Bull was soon niter issued by his Holiness, confirming the
possession of all that part of Whitby parish which lies on the west side of
the Eske to the Abbot and Convent of Whitby, and commanding Lord Peter
de Malo-lacu, and Mr. John of Tocotes, to give them no further disturbsnce
on that head ς bnt to defray all the expensos that hed been incur-red by this
law-suit.”

So far Chsrlton. 'No doubt the statement, “ came with an srmed force‚’'
depende upon his misunderstanding of the technicsl phrase “ υἱ et amnis.''
The complaint oi the Abbot and Convent to the Archbishop is authenticsoed
ΒΥ sn entry in Archbishop Wiekwaine's Reyister, p. 39, and again at p. 83,
which will be found printed below (No, 593), and from which it appears that
John de Tocotes engages to the Archbishop to restore the abstracted tithes‚
bnt with this reservation: ‘⁸ Salva eidem Rectori proprietatis qnaestione sd
decimas antedictas.” But there is no note of my threst of deposition or
excommunication. Unfortunstely, as already obser-ved in a previous note,
‘⁸ the rolls relating to this trial,” which were extant in Charlton's time, are
lost, and the story of the appeal to the Pope and of his Bull in reply cannot
be verified or disproved ΒΥ s reference to them, nor yet that of the “ trial st
common lsw ΒΥ spiritual judges '’ which preceded the appesl. But no doubt
can be thr-own upon the statement touching the names and ages of the
witnesses who msde depositioni, ss the Whitby historian relatos. Something
as to the nature of the depositione on the other side may be collected from
the depositions in reply ΒΥ the second list of witnesses given ΒΥ Chsrlton
(printed below ss N o. 592), snd no doubt csn remsin on reading them that the
entire “ process '’ was anything but ‘⁶ fictitious.” of course, it mightbe open
