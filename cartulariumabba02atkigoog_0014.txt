it. No clew even to what may possibly have become of it
seems to be obtainable,'’ and in a note it is added that some
notice of “ the conclusione arrived at by the editor as to the other
possible or supposed copies ’'—that is over and above the
- Strickland and Museum copies—“ assumed to have been avail-
able by Dodsworth or the writers he copies from, will also be ’¹
taken.

It is a noteworthy fact that throughout the Dodsworth col-
lectione only two documents are by him characterised as “ cartae
adhuc ineditae‚’' one of them being that which is printed above
as No. 576—being really a “ carta inedita”—the other that
printed as No. 57, with the addition of the names of a few
more witnesseS‚ namely “ Gileberto de Percy, Gaufrido Aveline,
Willelmo de Cumberlan de, Roberto de Tybatorp, Ricardo de
Mortemer, et Ricardo Gupil.” It is further noteworthy that
while references in the form “ Fol. 23,'’ or “f. 136b,” are numerous,
and others, in the form “ K. 30¹³? “ K. 34,'’ etc„ scarcely less 80,
the copy found at p. 126b of vol. 159 is thus noted at the side:
“ huc usque e collectionibus Βι Gascoigne e lib. de Whyteby.’'¹
But the references distinguished by the K are all equally to
Gascoigne's collectione, as those without any distinctive letter
or character are to the Strickland copy. And yet further it is
quite apparent that while the undistinctive references always
denote the Stricklaud copy and nothing beyond, Gascoigne's
references are found from time to time to include extracta from
the Museum copy as well as from the Strickland. But in no
case have references to other sources of information been met
with, excepting of course the “ libri de Whitby‚'' formerly in
the possession of the Cholmleys‚ and available up to Gascoigne’s
time. ,

To put this in another form :—No trace whatever remainS,
save in Tanner’s N otitia‚ of the existence of the Earl of Kent’s
copy, of the being of such a book. It is not intended by this
remark to throw discredit on Tanner’s accuracy3 but only to
note the fact· that, so far as the evidence goeS, it was not avail-
able either to Gascoigne, or to Dodsworth, or to the very many
and various sources on which Dodsworth so constantly and
avowedly drew. That there must have been other sources is
