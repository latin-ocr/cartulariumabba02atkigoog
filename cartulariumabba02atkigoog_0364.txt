704 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

2. william de Percy :¹ m. Christiana.²

¹ William de Percy de Castle Levingtom mistakenly made William de
Percy de Kildale in the Percy Feodary. “Infra fines term. Michaelis 15
Ric. 11. (1394), will. de Percy, filius Aliciae filiae Johannis filii Johannis de
Mennell, proavi Walteri de Boynton defuncti, frater et haeres praedicti
Walteri ” (they were both sons of the same mother, and in so far will. de
Percy was heir to Walter de Boynton), ‘⁶ tenet manerium de castel-levington‚
cum pert„ in feodo talliato de Rege in capite per homagium, fidelitatem et
servitium inveniendi Regi unum hominem cum equo discooperto, armatum
cum akewna, palletta, lancea et cirotecis de plate tempore guerrae in Scotia
per 11¹· dies ad costos suos proprios ε et extenta ad x li ;²'—a record in which
there is much of great interest apart from the facts oi family history involved.
This William de Percy “obiit infra festum S. Katharinae Virginis prox.
praeterit.,” the Inq. p. m. (from which the above extract is derived), being
taken at Gysbnrgh “ die aovin prox. post f. Annuntiationis B. M. V.
21 Ric. 11.,’' and in the said Inq. he is expressly called will„ de Percy de
Castle Levington. william, the son of the said William and his wife
Christiana, is named as “haeres propinquior‚'’ and as being “aetatis unius
quarterii anni et amplius.” From the Inq. p. m. of the mother, Christiana,
to be noticed presently, it is clear that this little heir died in his infancy.

² In the Percy Feod. stem, this Christiana, wife oi William de Percy de
Castle Levington, is made to be the granddaughter of the same personage,
as being the daughter of a second william de Percy de Radalo, son of the
last. She is further alleged to have been wife in the first instance to
“Henry Ld. Percy‚’' who at the date given could only have been Henry
Hotspur, an assei-tion heedlessly or recklessly inconsistent with history.
She is then stated to have died seised of the Manor of Kildale as well as of
those of Castle Levingtom Tampton and Newby, a statement equally incon-
sistent with the Inq. p. m. on which it is founded. It ia, however, correctly
stated that she became the wife of John Banks after her first husband's
death, with whom she joined in giving all her lands and tenements in Kil-
dale (mainly those originally granted by Arnold de Percy to his (ἲ) daughter
Katharine) to John de Percy [de Kildale] on condition of his rendering
thence annually xxx s. “ durante vita dictae Christianae.'’ This deed is dated
δ Heu. tv. 1402, or about six years after her first husband’s death. Her Inq.
p. m. was taken at Thin-sk, 5 Henr. V„ the date of her death being 10 Novr.
1417; and in it it is stated that the remainder, after an estate-tail of the
Manor oi Kirk·levington and land in Kildale, is to Margaret sister of win„ de
Percy her late husband, then the wife of Thomas Blanfront; that the tene·
ments in Kildale are held of John de Percy de Kildale, and are worth ms.
per annum3 that the said William and Christiana died without heire of
their bodies; that the aforesaid Margaret is forty years of age and upwards;
and lastly, what at present seems inexplicable, that Elisabeth H erynge (or
Herynges) is the said Christiana’s “ daughter and heir, and is of the age οἱ
eighteen years.”
