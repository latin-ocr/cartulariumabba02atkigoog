710 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

Eo vero tempore [1150-1160] praefati monachi nostri [de

form of a direct historical utterance by the Melsa Chronicler, while such a
conclusion is abundantly confirmed by the* language of the Continustor of
Symeon. Speaking of the mstorers of monkish religion in the north, he
says t-“Horum nomina fuerunt: Prior eornm aetate et moribus erat
Aldwinns, secundus Ealfwinus, tertius Rinfridus. Ex his tribus tris in
regione N orthymbrorum instaurata. sunt monasteris. Unum Dunelmi, . . .
aliud Eboraci in honorem Dei genitricis Mariae, . . . tertium autem in loco
qui quondam streneshald, . . . nunc Witebi appellatur.” A third con-
sideration originates in the character of the narrative purporting to be that
of Stephon of Whitby, or in the characteristics of the writer himself, who·
ever he may have been. Stephen is represented as having Men, by the
universal suffrages of the Whitby fraternity, with Reinfrid st their head,
and becked by the urgent representatione of the King and the two Arch-
bishops, compelled, however reluctantly, ιο assume the office and honours of
Abbot. Then he is advanced to be consecrated Abbot of Lastingham also
(ejusdem quoque loci Abbas consectarer). Then he has interviews with the
King and other great men. In other words, Stephon is exalted—or, snp-
posing him to be the writer, exalte himself—with loud blasts of the trumpet
vigorously blown, snd blown moreover with no uncertain sound. It πει
scarcely to be expected that such a writer, if Stephen were, in point οἱ
fact, merely one, even though he were the principal one, of a deputed body
οἱ monks whose mission it was “inchoare Monssterium B. Mariae,” could
permit himself ιο descend to the sober prose of the true narration. This
would have been to acknowledge subordination, where his object was to
elsim the fullest supremscy. of course if the narrative hsd been more
prohable in itself, had involved no contradictione and inoonsistencies, hsd
been more reconcilesble with certain facts and documents of undoubted
anthenticity, there would have been less reason to question or doubt its
veracity in matters of mainly personsl detail. But being what it is, we
have not far ιο seek for a motive quite sufficiently power-ful to cause its
author to ignore sny such fact as that alleged by the Melsa writer. The
encomiast οἱ the great first Abbot of the famous Abbey of S. Mary could not
permit himself to describe him as holding a subordinate position in the less
eminent House of Whitby, snd as merely the delegate of his monastic
superior in the steps thst were taken to initiate what eventually became the
great and magnificent Abbey of York. Assuming then that the Melas
Chronicler was, in the plain unvarnished statement in the text, alleging a
mere historical circumstance, familiarly remembered in his Convent from
its association with the personal history of the first Abbot of his Convent,
and certainly, as connected with the fact oi his having become the said first
Abbot, the most prominent circumstance in his personal history, we have
st once a sensible glow of light thrown upon the obscure episode, not so
much oi Stephen's connection with Whitby, as oi the seversnce of that con-
nection, and as to both its motive and its manner. From independent con·
siderations we heve reason to regand him as “s msn of mark,” a man
