¹ In the Mneeum at Scarborough, among other ancient‘documente pre·
sented by the late Captain Richardeon⁹ is 8 deod by Binaria, daughter of
Thomu de J oneby, giving power of attorney to william de Bovington, eon
01 william de Bovington, in the matter of 8 certain rent payable to the
Priorem of Mnnketon (Nun Monkton) out of lande in Acelum (Aelam), held
by the said Winiam de Bovington, the date of the deed being 1311. Α
Thomas de J oneby is aleo named in the Malton Car-tulary (Cott. uss.
Claud. D. xi. ), f. 68, 88 having married Joan, one of the daughters of Robert
Manyvylain. The william de J oneby of the present deed, ‘⁴ noster serviens,”
is probably 8 descendant, or at leuet connection.

² Ae this deed is dated in 1350, the Abbot ruling at the time must have
been Thomas de Haukoegarth.

³ ‘⁴ On the east eide of the Esk, Kirkgate hae received very large additione.
No street in Whitby hae obtained 8 greater variety of namen for, besides
the ancient name Kirkyate, it hae been called at various perinde, H iqhyate,
Hiqh Str-eet, Orouyate, Soutltqate, thmchqale, and, laatly, Charch Street.
The particular times when these names were severally adopted, or laid aeide,
it ie impossible to etate with precision, for 811 of them are used in various
writinge, between the years 1600 and 1700, and sometimes three of them
occur in one writing. Southqate was perhaps not the name of the whole
street, but only of that part of it which lay south from the end of Grape
Lane. The name Charcla Str-eet hae superseded 811 the rest for near 8

century.''-(Young’e wamy, p. 480.)
